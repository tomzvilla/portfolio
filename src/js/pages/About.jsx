            <p>
                My name is Tomas Villarreal, from Cordoba, Argentina. Since I was a child I was always interested in technology and computers.
                The first approach I had to them was as a gamer, dedicating countless hours to video games of all genres, from MMOs to shooters, RPGS, Platformers, MOBAs and many others.

                At the age of 17 I became interested in another part of technology, starting in the great adventure of programming, learning web development and video games.
                A great interest in this world led me to study software engineering in 2019, entering the National Technological University Regional CÃ³rdoba, 
                there I was formed professionally and met countless friends, whom I found as teammates and today are my colleagues engineers.

                In the last year of my career I had a significant advancement both personally and professionally, starting to work as a DevOps and part-time full stack programmer. At the same time, I was in the last year of my professional career and I was developing my final degree project. During that year I acquired countless knowledge, which trained and educated me in the best practices of software development, and instilled in me the idea of making secure, scalable and maintainable software. 
                I am a very proactive person, with a great passion for learning and challenges, constantly seeking to improve as a professional and as a person.
